most importantly, you need MySql 8.0 (or above) and an installation of MySql Workbench

create a mysql server with the name 'coursework', hosted on the testing machine (so accessible using localhost)

then, using the database dump found in the dump folder, go to Server -> Data Import
select the 'import from self-contained file' option, and ignore the default schema option.
then press Start Import.

finally go to Server -> Users & Privileges and add an account with the following details
username: flask
password: F1@sk***8
give it all permissions.

next, run the nginx executable in the nginx folder. this is not strictly necessary, but to test without nginx you must open the rendering.js and adjust
all fetch urls to be localhost:5000 instead of localhost

go into the server folder, and run the 'run.bat' file. (ignore 'run_smtp.bat' & 'debug_run.bat')

then finally open the index.html file in the site folder, and you're good to go.
